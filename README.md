# Inverter-Design-and-analysis
CMOS Circuits generally consists of a network split into two parts, Upper one referred to as a pull up network and the lower half as a pull down network. The former consists of P-channel MOSFETs and later N-Channel MOSFETs. Reason is simple. As one transistor is one, another is off. This eliminates the issue of an resistive path to the ground and hence, no voltage division occurs(At least not a significant one). This way, one can easily achieve a Strong High and a Strong LOW from the same network. PULL UP is what offers a low resistance path to the VDD and PULL DOWN is what offers a low resistance path the GND.
